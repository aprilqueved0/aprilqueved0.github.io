            <p>To my esteemed panel of Merrill faculty and alumni,</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;>
                With a foundation in investigative journalism and a background in logistics and supply chain management, I bring a unique perspective to data-driven storytelling—one that is grounded in systems thinking, accountability and an unwavering curiosity about the world around me.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;>
                My family comes from a country in which journalists are killed in direct reprisal for their work every year. My grandfather, a Mexico City bus-driver-turned-Chicagoland-factory-worker, held journalists in high regard for that exact reason. “To be a journalist,” he would tell me, “you have to be fast, you have to be smart and you have to be brave.” 
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;>
                Every morning, I watched him read Hoy, Chicago’s Spanish-language newspaper, and every evening, we watched Jorge Ramos anchor Noticiero Univision. Thus, from an early age, I knew I wanted to be one of those fast, smart and brave people who serve as watchdogs for underrepresented communities — my community. However, life pushed me in a different direction and it wasn’t until my grandfather passed away that I found the courage to pursue the career I had long dreamed of. 
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;>
                For eight years, I worked in logistics and supply chain management. Through my work, I developed a deep understanding of transportation systems and supply chain dynamics. Most importantly, I learned the incredible power and value of data and how to use it to effectively craft and deliver narratives to an audience.

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;>
                As I prepare to graduate, I am excited to present my portfolio to you. It reflects not only the skills I have developed and refined at Merrill but also my commitment to investigative journalism and to serving underrepresented communities through accessible storytelling. I deeply appreciate the opportunity to share my work and to reflect on how Merrill has provided a strong foundation and will continue to shape my career in journalism.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;>
                Thank you all for your time, guidance and for the role you have played in my development. 
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;>
                I welcome any feedback or questions.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you,<br>April Quevedo</p>
