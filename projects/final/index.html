                        <p><p><p>Each semester, M.J. candidates graduating from the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park are required to participate in MJ Day. The exercise requires M.J. candidates to individually recruit a panel consisting of three faculty members and one alumnus. A portfolio, which includes published and unpublished clips, a resume and cover letter, is the basis from which each candidate’s panel will provide feedback and recommendations as they prepare to enter the workforce. </p>

                        <p>MJ Day falls on May 9 this year. The first panels convene at 9 a.m. and run through mid-afternoon.</p>
                            
                        <p>The Spring 2025 graduating class consists of 14 students. Their graduation this month completes their starting cohort’s departure from the program – nine of their colleagues graduated last December. In total, the cohort consisted of 23 students (plus one adopted professional certificate student). </p>

                <div class="col-3">
                    <p>First, look at this dip for people in their 30's. These folks were eating noticeably fewer meals alone per month than people just a decade younger than them.</p>

                    <div class="col-3">
                        <p>I also noticed that once people hit 70 years old, they experienced a steep upward trend in solitary eating. Though, these data are from 2003 and a lot has changed in the 12 years between that survey and the most recent one from 2015.</p>

                    <div class="col-3">
                        <p>Once I added the data from 2015, the patterns really caught my attention. It looks like millenials and baby-boomers finally have something in common. Both groups have begun eating alone more frequently than people their age did back in 2003. On the other hand, the dining habits of the other age-groups remained relatively unchanged.</p>

                    <div class="col-3">
                        <p>I decided to slice the population into five age groups: 15 - 19, 20 - 30, 30 - 50, 50 - 75, and 75 - 85. These correspond to roughly alternating groups of no change / change in dining habits. Looking at the data this way, you may notice that these curves seem to follow the archetypal family life: living with parents, moving out, starting a family, having kids, empty nests, and growing old together. I wanted to see if there was more to this hypothesis.</p>

                        <p>To figure it out, I added data that reports with whom people share their meals. I hoped that this would help me figure out if the patterns observed from lone-diners do, in fact, match up with this quintessential American lifestyle. Below, you'll see the change in dining companions for each age group from 2003 to 2015.</p>

The data is broken down by the number of students in each cohort, the number of panelists, and the number of panelists who are alumni.</p>
